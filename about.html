          <h2>My background</h2>
          <p class="about-me-paragraph-1 mb-5">
            When I was growing up, I didn't know what I wanted to be. I had no
            idea what my strengths or weaknesses were. After a few months, I got
            tired of thinking about it so much and decided to just go with the
            flow. My aunt studied Social Communications and I liked it, so I
            went ahead and did the same thing! When I was about to graduate from
            college, I realized that my lack of knowledge would keep me from
            getting the job I wanted. That's when I started looking at how to
            improve my career prospects.

          <h2>First steps</h2>
          <p class="about-me-paragraph-2 mb-5">
            The first steps weren't easy. The information was way too much to
            handle.I soon discovered SheCodes, an online learning platform
            designed specifically for women with no technical background
            whatsoeverâ€”and they gave me a full scholarship! The program turned
            out to be amazing: it was easy to follow and engaging, and it helped
            me understand coding in a way that was fun rather than stressful.

            After months of hard work (and daily practice), I have made it to
